                    Website description:

                    The Gnomon Workshop provides training that both educates and inspires for visual effects artists,
                    concept designers, sculptors and comic book illustrators and traditional artists, using Maya,
                    ZBrush, 3ds Max, Photoshop and Painter as well as traditional drawing and painting.

                    Contrast:

                    There is sufficient contrast in the site with the black on white and light blue.

                    Repetition:

                    There is consistent repetition of layouts and sections throughout the website. Blue and gray color
                    stripes divide sections and content and make it easily readable.

                <li>
                    Alignment:

                    Each content section aligns the corresponding content by using the same color and placing elements
                    on the same grid as others from their class. There is a clear grid definition dividing content and
                    keeping uniformity throughout.

                    Proximity:

                    Content under the same section is grouped together and provides a sense of consistency as the user
                    browsers the website.

                    Suggestion for Improvement:

                    Add a sidebar with a navigation shortcut to reach content further down the website as it feels
                    substantially long as it is in the present state of the website.

                    Online calculator for quick calculations, along with a large collection of calculators on math,
                    finance, fitness, and more, each with related in-depth information.

                </li>

                <li>
                    Contrast:

                    There is a poor implementation of effective contrast in this website. The harsh white against the
                    light blue on the body of the site makes it hard for the user to read the links to the available
                    calculators.

                <li>
                    Repetition:

                    The website sports a wealth of information that seems disjointed because of the lack of consistent
                    design philosophy. Although there is repetition, it's very minimal and doesn't add to the ease of
                    readibility overall.

                    Alignment:

                    There is a severe lack of alignment across the website, especially when it comes to the individual
                    calculators themselves. The grid isn't clear and it is broken in most places across the website and
                    its navigation tools.

                    Proximity:

                    The site implements a certain degree of proximity, although it could be significantly improved as
                    there are several stray objects spread throughout the calculators and menus themselves.

                    Suggestion for Improvement:

                    The most glaring improvement the site is in dire need of is a proper use of contrast to aid the user
                    navigation experience and the visual appeal overall. Another change that needs to be made is
                    increased repetition to help the user associate content and have an easier time arriving at the
                    desired destination. Furthermore, the grid needs to be defined properly and followed consistently.
                    Finally, similar content needs better grouping to help improve the user's overall experience.
