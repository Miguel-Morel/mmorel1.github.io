<p style="font-size: medium;">
    Website description: this is a crappy website that violates every guideline in the book in order to prove the point
    that we should never build websites that suck and you never want to look at again.

    <br>
    Contrast: the contrast is nonexistent at best and hurts the eyes when trying to read the content on the screen.
    Rating: 1/5

    <br>
    Repetition: the only thing the wesbite is good at repeating is things that should have never existed in the first
    place. It is a cohort of abominations and design decisions that will make your eyes bleed.
    Rating: 1/5
    <br>
    Alignment: there is no alignment at all in this website. Elements and sections have simply been thrown on the canvas
    of the screen in order to build the worst possible looking excuse for a site there has ever been.
    Rating: 1/5
    <br>
    Proximity: just as there is no order to anything else on the website, elements that are similar have also not been
    paired with each other, and so proximity is a nonexistent in this page.
    Rating: 1/5
    <br>
    Suggestion for Improvement: implement an easily distinguishable color palette where the user can read the letters
    against the background color without any eyestrain. Employ repetition to establish patterns that the user can easily
    follow to find content anywhere on the website. Implement grid and alignment of every element on the site to provide
    visual order and improve overall navigation. The concept of proximity doesn't exist on this site, and needs to be
    integrated in order to help the user associate content and interact with it in a more efficient way.
